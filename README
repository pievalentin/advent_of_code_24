Back in school i only had a brief intro to C and some arduino.
I am taking advent of code 24 to learn and practice cpp. 

I am using cursor to learn along the way. you can find the system prompt in the `.cursorrules`
This is a learning opportunity not competitiv code ^^'



# day 1
I learned about:
- the optional type to be able to return the equivalent of an error without a 
throw
- using recent c std17, I think you have access to elegant loops
